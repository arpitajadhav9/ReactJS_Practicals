    <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <p>I'm a Front-End Developer with a knack for creating responsive and visually appealing websites. With a background in computer science and a love for design, I bridge the gap between technical and creative solutions. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest web technologies or enjoying a good book.
